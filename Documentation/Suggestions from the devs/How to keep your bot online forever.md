# **What we do**

At MGS we always have problems that we bump into. We had a problem with the bot being offline especially. It took a little bit of research to find out how to fix this problem, but we did figure it out. We used [Better Uptime](https://uptimerobot.com/) to keep our bot on 24/7! Here, we will explain exactly how to keep your bot on for free.
