**THIS BOT IS MADE BY zenoytleader, hayleepurplecake, and ploof.png!**

In places where it says token, you need to make a secret in [replit](https://replit.com) or [visual code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for visual studio, you need to paste your actual token in the login. Ex: client.login("YOUR BOT TOKEN") ). Name the secret token and paste you discord bots token there. discord.js is needed to make all of this work. You can always add more commands or edit the ones already there. If any errors are found, just tell us, we don't want you guys to not understand why it didn't work.

replit: 
```js 
client.login(process.env.token);
```

visual studio: 
```js 
client.login("TOKEN");
```

* Note: We think the reason for this is for your bots safety. Visual studio is a one person platform, so your token can't really be seen by anyone else unless you show them. Replit projects are all public, so anyone can see it (unless you pay to get it private). That's why replit created the [secret](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/workspace-features/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables) tool so all your tokens or private things stay private.

# **INFO:**

Made with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), programmed by [Mountain Gaming Studios](https://mgsbot.vercel.app/), 100% safe, interaction bot. Please don't edit the code for the wrong reasons. Use this nicely. All file names are what you need to name them when creating your file. For example, if you're trying to do the [index.js](https://github.com/Zenoleader/MGS-Bot/blob/main/Main-files/index.js), you need to go to where ever you are programming and make a file called [index.js](https://github.com/Zenoleader/MGS-Bot/blob/main/Main-files/index.js). Same for everything else. You will need to download **[discord.js v13](https://v13.discordjs.guide/)**. No other version will work with the code provided. The MGS bot team uses [replit](https://replit.com) to program our bot (We recommend this if you are working with a team)! (Codes are all modified so they don't look exactly like the actual MGS commands. This is due to copying and people being lazy)

**YOU ADD ALL THE COMMANDS IN THE INDEX.JS FILE INSIDE THE SAME CLIENT:** 

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js')
//remember it's v13

const client = new Discord.Client({intents: ["GUILDS", "GUILD_MESSAGES"]}); 
//you can always add more intents

client.on("messageCreate", message => {
  if(message.content === 'hello') {
    message.channel.send("Hi.")
  }
  if(message.content === "this is the second thing") {
  message.channel.send("Ok üëå")
  }
}) 
``` 

*refer to [Example Code.js](https://github.com/Zenoleader/MGS-Bot/blob/main/Example%20Code.js) if you still don't understand.

**DOWNLOAD [DISCORD.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/): ```npm i discord.js@13.15.1```** 

**‚ö†Ô∏è WE WILL NOT SPOON FEED YOU WITH PROGRAMMING. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING PLEASE TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT FIRST THEN ASK US.‚ö†Ô∏è**

# **MGS Economy ToS**

**1. Terms of Service:** MGS has an economy feature that‚Äôs fun to use when people don't use it for the wrong reasons. With these terms, we will specify what we do when you use the economy & what is not allowed. **Note: All the normal ToS for MGS apply here, so we won't specify the normal terms.**

**2. Logging:** MGS does log all the actions with the economy except for fishing & hunting. **We store things such as your User ID, Guild ID's, User Tags, and profile pictures.** We store all that with quick.db & it's in private channels only developers have access to.

**3. Scamming:** MGS has a gift command that can obviously be abused. We do not tolerate scamming, and if the action is done, **we will ban your access to all of MGS.**

**4. Grinding Bots:** MGS has commands that are specifically meant for normal grinding. We are aware of people who make grinding bots that spam MGS's API. **Doing so will get your access to MGS revoked. Your data will also be deleted. This does include PREMIUM.**

**5. Inorganic Grinding/Growth:** MGS Is meant to be a fair and fun bot. Using methods to inorganically grow your Moolah is against our ToS. **Doing so will get your access to MGS revoked. Your data will also be deleted. This does include PREMIUM.**

**8.Intentional Bot Crashing:** Crashing the bot will not be tolerated. Not only is this annoying, it's bad for our servers. Doing so will result in a blacklist.

**9. Questions:** Have any questions or concerns about our terms? Don't fret, just email us: [mgsmoderation@gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=mgsmoderation@gmail.com). **Our responses could take 3-5 business days.**
